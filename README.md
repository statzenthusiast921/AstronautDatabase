# AstronautDatabase

### Description

The purpose of this project was to visualize the networks of all astronauts connected by each mission for which they participated.  

### Data

The data used for this analysis was scraped from the [SuperCluster Astronaut Database](https://www.supercluster.com/astronauts).


### Challenges

Scraping the data proved to be tricky as the countries of origin did not populate appropriately for many astronauts.  Because of this, manual research was required to fill out this portion of the dataset.  Two problems arose through this process:
- How to assign countries to astronauts with dual citizenship
- How to assign countries to cosmonauts around the fall of the Soviet Union (USSR vs. Russia)
