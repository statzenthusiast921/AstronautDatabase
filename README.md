# AstronautDatabase

### Description

The purpose of this project was to visualize the networks of all astronauts connected by each mission for which they participated.  

### Data

The data used for this analysis was scraped from the [SuperCluster Astronaut Database](https://www.supercluster.com/astronauts).


### Challenges

Scraping the data proved to be a little tricky as the countries of origin did not populate appropriately for many astronauts.  Manual research was required to fill out this portion of the dataset.
